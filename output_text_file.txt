REPAIR METHODS
1. Plumbing Services
Fixing Leaks and Clogs
●
Repair Method: For leaks, first shut off the water supply. Clean the area around the
leak, then apply plumber's tape around the threads of the leaking pipe or joint. For clogs,
use a plunger to create a seal over the drain and push down repeatedly to dislodge the
blockage. If the plunger doesn’t work, use a drain snake to reach deeper clogs.
Regularly pour boiling water down the drain to prevent future clogs.
Repairing or Replacing Faucets, Sinks, and Toilets
●
Repair Method: To fix a leaky faucet, start by turning off the water supply. Remove the
faucet handle, then replace the worn washer or O-ring inside. For sinks, check for and
tighten any loose connections. For toilet repairs, check the flapper and fill valve; replace
any worn parts. Regular maintenance includes tightening bolts and checking for leaks
around seals.
Water Heater Repair or Installation
●
Repair Method: For minor water heater issues, check the thermostat settings and reset
if necessary. If there’s no hot water, the heating element may need replacement. Flush
the tank annually to remove sediment buildup. If the heater leaks, check for loose
connections or cracks in the tank, which may need professional replacement if severe.
2. Electrical Services
Replacing or Installing Light Fixtures and Ceiling Fans
●
Repair Method: Ensure the power is turned off at the circuit breaker before starting.
Remove the old fixture by unscrewing it from the ceiling. Connect the wires of the new
fixture to the existing wires in the ceiling, matching the colors (black to black, white to
white). Secure the fixture to the ceiling and turn the power back on to test the installation.
Troubleshooting and Fixing Electrical Issues
●
Repair Method: Begin by identifying the problem area. Reset any tripped circuit
breakers or replace blown fuses. If an outlet or switch isn’t working, turn off the power
and remove the cover to check for loose connections or burnt wires. Replace any
damaged components. Always ensure the power is off when working on electrical
repairs to avoid shocks.
Upgrading or Repairing Outlets and Switches
●
Repair Method: Turn off the power to the outlet or switch at the circuit breaker. Remove
the cover plate and the screws holding the outlet or switch in place. Carefully pull it out
and disconnect the wires. Connect the wires to the new outlet or switch, ensuring they
are secured tightly. Push the new unit back into the wall and secure with screws, then
replace the cover plate.
3. HVAC Services
Repairing or Servicing Heating and Cooling Systems
●
Repair Method: Regularly replace air filters to ensure efficient airflow. Clean the

the system isn’t cooling or heating properly, a refrigerant recharge or professional
service may be required.
Installing New HVAC Units
●
Repair Method: Installation of a new HVAC unit is complex and typically requires
professional service. However, ensure the unit is properly sized for your home. Clear the
installation area and provide proper ventilation. Connect the unit to existing ductwork
and electrical systems. Follow manufacturer instructions carefully. Regular maintenance
includes cleaning filters and inspecting ducts.
Cleaning and Maintaining Ducts
●
Repair Method: Remove vent covers and use a vacuum with a long hose to clean inside
the ducts. For deeper cleaning, consider renting a duct-cleaning machine. Inspect ducts
for leaks and seal any gaps with duct tape or mastic sealant. Regular cleaning improves
air quality and system efficiency. Professional duct cleaning is recommended every few
years.

around the frame to seal gaps.
Building or Fixing Cabinetry and Shelving
●
Repair Method: Tighten any loose screws and replace damaged hardware. Use wood
filler to fill in cracks or holes, then sand smooth. For sagging shelves, add additional
support brackets underneath. When building new cabinetry, measure and cut wood to
size, assemble using screws and wood glue, and finish with paint or stain for a polished
look.
Structural Repairs and Modifications
●

the next. Protect surrounding areas with painter’s tape and drop cloths.
Repairing or Replacing Damaged Drywall
●
Repair Method: For small holes, use a patch kit with a self-adhesive mesh. Apply joint
compound over the patch, smooth it out, and sand when dry. For larger holes, cut a
piece of drywall to fit the hole, secure it with screws, and cover with joint compound.
Sand smooth and paint to match the surrounding wall.
Wallpaper Removal and Installation
●
Repair Method: Use a wallpaper steamer or a solution of water and wallpaper remover
to soften the adhesive. Peel off the wallpaper, starting at a corner. Clean the wall to
remove any remaining adhesive. For installation, measure and cut wallpaper to size,
apply adhesive to the back, and carefully align and smooth onto the wall, removing air
bubbles as you go.

decking is inspected for damage. Install underlayment and new shingles according to
manufacturer instructions. Proper ventilation and flashing are critical to prevent future
issues.
Gutter Installation and Repair
●
Repair Method: Clean out debris from gutters regularly. For leaks, apply gutter sealant

ensuring a proper slope for water drainage.
